# Python Course - Udacity

This repository was created to save the exercises completed in the **Python course** - Udacity
It can be noted that the files start from lesson 6.7. This is because, up to module 5, the exercises are completed directly on Udacity's website using the online Anaconda available in the lessons. Only after that did the installation preparations for the module 6 lessons begin.
